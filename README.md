### Step 2: Create Your Document
In your document include the following information:<br/><br/>

__Title__
Title of your article <br/><br/>

__Author__
Your First and Last Name / Handle <br/><br/>

__Track Category__
Choose between: Design, Development, Data Science, Competitive Programming, QA, Topcoder <br/><br/>

__Subcategory__
Is your article about a specific technology, application, tool, or theory?  Write down that specific item here. <br/><br/>

__Tags__
Use comma-separated words/phrases that further explains your article.  For example, the primary theme of your article may be about Java (which would be your subcategory) but you also talk about “Binary Trees” and have some “Python” code written in there.  For this tags section you would then write:

_Binary Trees, Python_ <br/><br/>

__Read Time__
About how long will it take an average reader to read your article?  <br/><br/>

If you’d like a more accurate result there is a Google Extension called Reading Time that can help you estimate. <br/><br/>

__Banner Image__
Paste a link to the image you would like used for this article.  Make sure that the image is not copyrighted and that the dimensions of the image are at a minimum 760 pixels wide and 555 pixels tall. <br/><br/>

__Content__
Here is where you provide the content of your article.  If there are images you wish to use in your content, remember to paste the link to the image as we are not able to download the image if you paste that in your document.  If you are at all familiar with Markdown, please use that format to create your content. <br/><br/>

### Step 3: Share Your Document
The basic flow for handling a ticket is as follows:
1. Create a ticket/issue in our repo that has your submission in it as an attachment or a link to your document. Post a comment with the track it belongs to: `Design`, `Development`, `Data Science`, `Competitive Programming`, `QA` or `Topcoder` in the issue.
2. Your submission will be reviewed by a track evangelist and copilot.
3. If the review is accepted, the evangelist or copilot will set its label to `Passed Review`, if the review is rejected `Rejected Review`, or if there is feedback for you (evangelist or copilot will make a comment in the ticket) `Review Feedback`.
4. Payments will be processed by the project copilot immediately upon the publishing of the article and the ticket will enter the `tcx_FixAccepted` and then finally `tcx_Paid` state.
5. For tickets labeled `Review Feedback` you have 12h to handle/update the request by the copilot in your submission.
6. If you want to reserve a topic for writing on it, you can put [WIP] as a prefix to issue title and submit when ready. No more than 3 active reservations will be allowed per member.

**Members that violate the repo rules will be removed and will lose access to the project!**
